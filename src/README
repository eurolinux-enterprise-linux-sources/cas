Requirements

/etc/cas.conf - This needs to be modified with your directory specifics. 
Comments in the conf file are pretty straight forward.

A cas database needs to be prepared which houses all the build timestamps 
of the debug kernels you wish to use.

As root run:

# cas-admin -b

Build your server database:

# cas-admin -s

Running CAS

Once completed take a generated kernel dump and send it through cas:

# cas -i <ID> -f vmcore -m username@example.com

The vmcore may be in the form of http/ftp (e.g. http://myhost.com/files/vmcore.tar.gz).

The compression scheme for a vmcore should be in the form of one of the following:

# tar cvzf vmcore.tar.gz vmcore
# tar cvjf vmcore.tar.bz2 vmcore
# gzip vmcore
# bzip2 vmcore

or you may pass it an uncompressed vmcore.

Please do not _double compress_! For example, do not do a gzip vmcore, 
then a tar cvzf vmcore.tar.gz vmcore.gz as you will not gain anything 
from this. CAS will also fail to detect the decompression type.

Once complete results should be emailed to the address specified or if 
processed locally should be prepared for you to do further analyzation 
within crash.

If any problem occurs please check the log within
/your/core/processed_dir/identifier/identifier.log
